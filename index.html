		<h2>The Story</h2>
			<p style=" font-size: 20px;">
				Pickforks was created because I thought that the current way that people find interior designers is not the optimal way. With so many options, it's a challenge for both to find the right match. And most of the time, we settle on the one that's available. Or settle because time runs out on us. <strong>Pickforks</strong> was made because its a <em>better</em> way for interior designers to find homeowners, and for homeowners to find them.
