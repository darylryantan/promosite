	<h2>THE STORY</h2>
		<p>
			Pickforks was created because I thought that the current way that people find interior designers is not the optimal way. With so many options, it's a challenge for a homeowner to find the right one. And most of the time, we settle on the one that's available. Or settle because time runs out on us. <strong>Pickforks</strong> was made because its a <em>better</em> way to help you find the right one.
